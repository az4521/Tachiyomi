### fix
- [ ] [reverse search order for EH/ExH](https://github.com/az4521/TachiyomiAZ/issues/70)
- [ ] [exh thumbnails sometimes don't load](https://github.com/az4521/TachiyomiAZ/issues/78)
- [ ] smart background doesn't work
### match stable/j2k
- [ ] [add comicinfo xml stuff](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/commit/1395343f116bfbc9c3ee04eed372299ea36aa22d)
- [ ] j2k: editing manga info - [j2k commit](https://github.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomiJ2K/commit/d3ec230d4baa8584118dc30807728305715db25b)
- [ ] CBZ support - [related](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajobobby04%2FTachiyomiSY+cbz&type=commits&s=committer-date&o=asc)
- [ ] add all the new trackers (komga, bakaupdates, etc.)
- [ ] re-order per-source downloads (idk what this one even means, kraxen added it)
### maybe
- [ ] [side padding thing](https://github.com/az4521/TachiyomiAZ/issues/86)
- [ ] syncyomi support (see [this pr](https://github.com/jobobby04/TachiyomiSY/pull/1005))
- [ ] hide chapters in chapter list (alternative to filtering by uploaders cuz i think that doesn't work well when there's a brief period where two groups are scanlating the same manga before one drops it yknow)
- [ ] [show newer exh galleries as already in library if older versions are](https://github.com/az4521/TachiyomiAZ/issues/91)
- [ ] allow hiding the "last used source" in the sources menu
- [ ] cookie login for eh/exh
- [ ] search bar for settings
- [ ] update translations
- [ ] add quick shortcut to extension repos in "Extensions" tab
- [ ] migrate extension stuff from RX to coroutines
- [ ] extension repo list: remove category icon, add left-right padding
- [ ] bump api version and use scoped storage
